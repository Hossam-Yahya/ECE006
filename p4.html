A low-level language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction of programming concepts and is very close to writing actual machine instructions” (computerhope, n.d.).

Low-level language like Assembler is close to the hardware and does not provide any abstraction. This language can convert to machine code without any compiler or interpreter. Program written using this kind of language can be made to run quickly while using less memory. Any program written using this language will be more effective and fast than the same program that was written using any high-level…show more content…
This type of programming languages includes famous languages like Java, C#, C++, etc. Medium-level languages are statically typed and focused on abstractions. Unlike low-level languages, you should not manage memory (however, you can do it) and it a big variety of libraries. Medium-level language are commonly used and it is a good choice between speed of low-level languages and simplicity of high-level languages. It is advantage and disadvantage in the same time. It is not as fast as low-level language and not as simple as high-level language.

“High-level languages are designed to be used by the human operator or the programmer. They are referred to as "closer to humans." In other words, their programming style and context is easier to learn and implement than low-level languages, and the entire code generally focuses on the specific program to be created” (techopedia, n.d.).

High-level languages tend refers to the highest level of abstraction from binary code. There are big variety of options in high-level languages that would solve complex tasks just in a few lines of code. It includes objects, complex arithmetic or Boolean expressions, subroutines, threads and other abstract concepts. Probably the most famous high-level language is python. This language is dynamically typed, so when you use variables, you never should worry about type of variable, complier will determine variable
